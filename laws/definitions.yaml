# definitions.yaml
#
# Canonical definitions used across all laws and bylaws.
# Each definition follows the structure:
#
#   term:
#     definition: <core meaning>
#     exceptions: <what it does NOT include>
#     examples: <illustrative cases, edge cases>
#     notes: <context, sourcing, refinement history>
#
# Definitions start loose and are refined over time by adding
# exceptions and conditions — never by narrowing the core definition.

american:
  definition: >
    Any person who has spent any amount of time on American soil.
  exceptions: []
  examples:
    - born citizen
    - naturalized citizen
    - visa holder
    - undocumented resident
    - tourist passing through
  notes: >
    Intentionally the loosest possible definition. To be refined
    with exceptions and conditions as needed — not by restricting
    the core meaning.

bird:
  definition: >
    A feathered biped.
  exceptions:
    - A man who has been tarred and feathered (still a man, not a bird).
  examples:
    ordinary:
      - sparrow
      - eagle
      - robin
    strange:
      - emu
      - ostrich
      - penguin
      - kiwi
    definitively not a bird:
      - Diogenes' plucked chicken
  notes: >
    Reference: Plato defined man as a "featherless biped." Diogenes
    of Sinope plucked a chicken, brought it to the Academy, and
    declared "Behold! I have brought you Plato's man." Plato amended
    his definition to "featherless biped with broad flat nails."
    Lesson: definitions need exceptions.
